# Add to Cart App

This is a simple web application called "Add to Cart App" that allows you to add items to a shopping list in real-time using Firebase Realtime Database.

## How it Works

The application uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve the shopping list items. It has the following functionalities:

1. **Add Items**: Enter an item in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the shopping list. The item will be saved to the Firebase Realtime Database in real-time.

2. **Real-time Update**: The shopping list is updated in real-time whenever a new item is added or an existing item is removed.

3. **Remove Items**: Click on an item in the shopping list to remove it from the list and the database.

## Firebase Integration

The app uses Firebase for real-time data storage. It utilizes Firebase's JavaScript SDK to initialize the app, connect to the database, and perform operations like push new items and remove existing ones.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Type an item name in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the shopping list.

3. Click on an item in the shopping list to remove it.
